Hi, my name is Afonso, i go by QUVSE

I'm very interested in all things tech and music. I'm still trying to find my niche (in both worlds).

I'm currently following The Odin Project curriculum, specifically in the last quarter of the foundations chapter.

After following foundations I'm unsure if I should specialize right away in TOP(i might), or if i take the plunge and learn CS50 course in the OSSU repository.

You can reach me irl hehe, I will build various professional profiles when foundations is finished. Until then I only have personals (which I will never share here hehe).
